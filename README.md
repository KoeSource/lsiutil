SCSI Target Mode for LSISAS2 and LSISAS3 Host Bus Adapters
==========================================================

This set of files provides support for adding SCSI Target Mode (STM) support to
Yocto (https://www.yoctoproject.org/) based targets using the SCST 
(http://scst.sourceforge.net/) framework.

If you want to use the SCST and Linux kernel patches outside of Yocto, look at
the following two patch files:

    recipes-kernel/linux/linux-stable/linux-stable-4.1-mpt3sas_stm.patch

    recipes-protocols/scst/files/0001-add-mpt3.patch


Installation Example Debian 11

recipes-support/lsiutil/files/lsiutil-1.72.tar.gz  
tar -xvf lsiutil-1.72.tar.gz  
cd lsiutil  
apt-get install build-essential   
make -f Makefile_Linux  

Requirements
------------

### Supported HBAs
SAS2.x (6Gbps)
* 9200-8e
* 9200-4i4e
* Any device based on the LSISAS2008 chipset with LSI IT firmware

SAS3.x (12Gbps)
* 9300-8e
* 9300-4i4e
* Any device based on the LSISAS3008 chipset with LSI IT firmware

### Supported versions of Yocto
This layer is known to work with Yocto version 1.7 and 1.8, and is maintained
against the poky 'master' branch.

### Supported Linux kernels
This layer is known to work with linux-stable 4.1.3, and may work with any
relatively recent Linux branch depending on the status of the LSI mpt3sas 
driver code.

### Supported version of SCST
This layer patch is known to work against SCST 3.0 

Configuration
-------------

### HBA Configuration
In addition to having a compatible HBA, you must configure the HBA to enable
Target SCSI operations. To do this, you must use the 'lsiutil' command line
tool which is included with the packagegroup-stm-core package defined in this
layer. See Appendix 1 below for specifics on using the lsiutil command.

### Yocto Configuration
In order for Yocto to use this layer, you must add it to your layers.conf
file.



Appendix 1: Configuring HBAs with lsituil
=========================================
The lsiutil utility allows you to edit NVDATA paramaters on the HBA to 
activate hardware and firmware Target I/O capabilities. In order to operate
correctly, each PHY to be connected to a remote host must be part of a distinct
port, and only a single port is supported in the current patch set.

### Example 
Here is an example of how one HBA has been configured with a single x4 port for
normal Initator traffic, and a second x4 port for Target traffic:
